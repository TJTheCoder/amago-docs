# AMAGO Website

You need to be in conda environment with python 3.10.

In ~/amago, run:
-> ./driver

You can append the -s flag to ./driver to suspend the program in the middle,
allowing you to manually edit files in the ~/amago/sync folder (pulled from 
https://github.com/UT-Austin-RPL/amago/tree/crr_k).
