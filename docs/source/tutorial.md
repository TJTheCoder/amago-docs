### **1. Setup the Environment**


AMAGO follows the `gymnasium` (0.26 < version < 0.30) environment API.
A typical `gymnasium.Env` simulates a single instance of an environment. We'll be collecting data in parallel by creating multiple independent instances. All we need to do is define a function that creates an `AMAGOEnv`, for example:

```python
import gymnasium
import amago

def make_env():
  env = gymnasium.make("Pendulum-v1")
  # `env_name` is used for logging. Some multi-task envs will sample a new env between resets and change the name accordingly.
  env = amago.envs.AMAGOEnv(env=env, env_name="Pendulum", batched_envs=1)
  return env


sample_env = make_env()
# If the env doesn't have dict observations, AMAGOEnv will create one with a default key of 'observation':
sample_env.observation_spce
# >>> Dict('observation': Box([-1. -1. -8.], [1. 1. 8.], (3,), float32))
# environments return an `amago.hindsight.Timestep`
sample_timestep, info = sample_env.reset()
# each environment has a batch dimension of 1
sample_timestep.obs["observation"].shape
# >>> (1, 3) 

experiment = amago.Experiment(
  make_train_env=make_env,
  make_val_env=make_env,
  parallel_actors=36,
  env_mode="async", # or "sync" for easy debugging / reduced overhead
  ..., # we'll be walking through more arguments below
)

```

#### Vectorized Envs and `jax`
<details>

Some domains already parallelize computation over many environments: `step` expects a batch of actions and returns a batch of observations. Examples include recent envs like [`gymnax`](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) that use [`jax`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a GPU to boost their framerate:
```python
import gymnax 
from amago.envs.builtin.gymnax_envs import GymnaxCompatability

def make_env():
  env, params = gymnax.make("Pendulum-v1")
  # AMAGO expects numpy data and an unbatched observation space
  vec_env = GymnaxCompatability(env, num_envs=512, params=params)
  # vec_env.reset()[0].shape >>> (512, 3) # already vectorized!
  return AMAGOEnv(env=vec_env, env_name=f"gymnax_Pendulum", batched_envs=512)

experiment = amago.Experiment(
  make_train_env=make_env,
  make_val_env=make_env,
  parallel_actors=512, # match batch dim of environment
  env_mode="already_vectorized", # prevents spawning multiple async instances
  ...,
)
```

There are some details in getting the pytorch agent and jax envs to cooperate and share a GPU. See `examples/02_gymnax.py`.

> *NOTE*: Support for `jax` and other GPU-batched envs is a recent experimental feature. Please refer to the latest `jax` documentation for instructions on installing versions compatible with your hardware.

#### Meta-RL and Auto-Resets

<details>

Most meta-RL problems involve an environment that resets itself to the same task `k` times. There is no consistent way to handle this across different benchmarks. Therefore, **AMAGO expects the environment to be handling `k`-shot resets on its own.** `terminated` and `truncated` indicate that this environment interaction is finished and should be saved/logged. For example:

```python
from amago.envs import AMAGO_ENV_LOG_PREFIX

class MyMetaRLEnv(gym.Wrapper):
  
  def reset(self):
    self.sample_new_task_somehow()
    obs, info = self.env.reset()
    self.current_episode = 0
    self.episode_return = 0
    return obs, info
  
  def step(self, action):
    next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)
    self.episode_return += reward
    if terminated or truncated:
      # "trial-done"
      next_obs, info = self.reset_to_the_same_task_somehow()
      # we'll log anything in `info` that begins with `AMAGO_ENV_LOG_PREFIX`
      info[f"{AMAGO_ENV_LOG_PREFIX} Ep {self.current_episode} Return"] = self.episode_return
      self.episode_return = 0
      self.current_episode += 1
    # only indicate when the rollout is finished and the env needs to be completely reset
    done = self.current_episode >= self.k
    return next_obs, reward, done, done, info
```

An important limitation of this is that **while AMAGO will automatically organize meta-RL policy inputs for the previous action and reward, it is not aware of the reset signal**. If we need the trial reset signal it can go in the observation. We could concat an extra feature or make the observation a dict with an extra `reset` key. The `envs/builtin/` envs contain many examples.

</details>

### **2. Pick a Sequence Embedding (`TstepEncoder`)**


Each timestep provides a dict observation along with the previous action and reward. AMAGO standardizes its training process by creating a `TstepEncoder` to map timesteps to a fixed size representation. After this, the rest of the network can be environment-agnostic. We include customizable defaults for the two most common cases of images (`nets.tstep_encoders.CNNTstepEncoder`) and state arrays (`nets.tstep_encoders.FFTstepEncoder`). All we need to do is tell the `Experiment` which type to use:

```python
from amago.nets.tstep_encoders import CNNTstepEncoder

experiment = amago.Experiment(
  make_train_env=make_env,
  ...,
  tstep_encoder_type=CNNTstepEncoder,
)
```

#### Create Your Own `TstepEncoder`

<details>

If our environment has multi-modal dict observations or we want to customize the network in a way that isn't covered by the defaults' options, we could do something like this:

```python
from torch import nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

from amago import TstepEncoder
# there's no specific requirement to use AMAGO's pytorch modules, but
# we've built up a collection of common RL components that might be helpful!
from amago.nets.cnn import NatureishCNN
from amago.nets.ff import Normalization

class MultiModalRobotTstepEncoder(TstepEncoder):
  def __init_(
      obs_space: gym.spaces.Dict,
      rl2_space: gym.spaces.Box,
  ):
    super().__init__(obs_space=obs_space, rl2_space=rl2_space)
    img_space = obs_space["image"]
    joint_space = obs_space["joints"]
    self.cnn = NatureishCNN(img_shape=img_space.shape)
    cnn_out_shape = self.cnn(self.cnn.blank_img).shape[-1]
    self.joint_rl2_emb = nn.Linear(joint_space.shape[-1] + rl2_space.shape[-1], 32)
    self.merge = nn.Linear(cnn_out_shape + 32, 128)
    # we'll represent each Timestep as a 64d vector
    self.output_layer = nn.Linear(128, 64) 
    self.out_norm = Noramlization("layer", 64)

  @property
  def emb_dim(self):
    # tell the rest of the model what shape to expect
    return 64
  
  def inner_forward(self, obs, rl2s, log_dict=None):
    """
    `obs` is a dict and `rl2s` are the previous reward + action.
    All tensors have shape (batch, length, dim)
    """
    img_features = self.cnn(obs["image"])
    joints_and_rl2s = torch.cat((obs["joints"], rl2s), dim=-1)
    joint_features = F.leaky_relu(self.joint_rl2_emb(joints_and_rl2s))
    merged = torch.cat((img_features, joint_features), dim=-1)
    merged = F.leaky_relu(self.merge(merged))
    out = self.out_norm(self.output_layer(merged))
    return out

experiment = amago.Experiment(
  ...,
  tstep_encoder_type=MultiModalRobotTstepEncoder,
)
``` 
</details>

### **3. Pick a Sequence Model (`TrajEncoder`)**


The `TrajEncoder` is a seq2seq model that enables long-term memory and in-context learning by processing a sequence of `TstepEncoder` outputs. `nets.traj_encoders` includes four built-in options :

1. `FFTrajEncoder`: processes each timestep independently with a residual feedforward block. It has no memory! This is a useful sanity-check that isolates the impact of memory on performance.

2. `GRUTrajEncoder`: a recurrent model. Long-term recall is challenging because we need to learn what to remember or forget at each timestep, and it may awhile before new info is relevant to decision-making. However, inference speed is constant over long rollouts.

3. `MambaTrajEncoder`: [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) is a state-space model with similar conceptual strengths and weaknesses as an RNN. However, it runs significantly faster during training.

4. `TformerTrajEncoder`: a Transformer model with a number of tricks for stability in RL. Transformers are great at RL memory problems because they don't "forget" anything and only need to learn to *retrieve* info at timesteps where it is immediately useful. There are several choices of self-attention mechanism. We recommend [flash_attn](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) if it will run on your GPU. There is experimental support for [`flex_attention`](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention/) (pytorch >= 2.5). See the "Customize Anything Else" section for how to switch defaults.

We can select a `TrajEncoder` just like a `TstepEncoder`:

```python
from amago.nets.traj_encoders import MambaTrajEncoder

experiment = amago.Experiment(
  ...,
  traj_encoder_type=MambaTrajEncoder,
)
```

If we wanted to try out a new sequence model we could subclass `amago.TrajEncoder` like the `TstepEncoder` example above.


<br>

### **4. Pick an `Agent`**


The `Agent` puts everything together and handles actor-critic RL training ontop of the outputs of the `TrajEncoder`. There are two high-level options:

1. `Agent`: the default learning update described in Appendix A of the paper. It's an off-policy actor-critic (think [DDPG](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html)) with some stability tricks like random critic ensembling and training over multiple discount factors in parallel.

2. `MultiTaskAgent`: The `Agent` training objectives depend on the scale of returns (`Q(s, a)`) across our dataset, which might be a problem when those returns vary widely, like when we're training on multiple tasks at the same time. `MultiTaskAgent` replaces critic regression with two-hot classification (as in [DreamerV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04104)), and throws out the policy gradient in favor of filtered behavior cloning. This update is much better in hybrid meta-RL/multi-task problems where we're optimizing multiple reward functions (like Meta-World ML45, Multi-Game Procgen, or Multi-Task BabyAI). We wrote a [second paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OSHaRf4TVU) about it.

We can switch between them with:
```python
from amago.agent import MultiTaskAgent

experiment = amago.Experiment(
  ...,
  agent_type=MultiTaskAgent,
)
```

<br>

### **5. Configure the `Experiment`**

The `Experiment` has lots of other kwargs to control things like the ratio of data collection to learning updates, optimization, and logging. Formal documentation for `Experiment` and the rest of the modules is coming soon. For now, you can find an explanation of each setting in the comments at the top of `amago/experiment.py`


<br>

### **6. Configure Anything Else**

We try to keep the settings of each `Experiment` under control by using [`gin`](https://github.com/google/gin-config) to configure individual pieces like the `TstepEncoder`, `TrajEncoder`, `Agent`, and actor/critic heads. You can read more about `gin` [here](https://github.com/google/gin-config/blob/master/docs/index.md)... but hopefully won't need to. We try to make this easy: our code follows a simple rule that, if something is marked `@gin.configruable`, none of its `kwargs` are set, meaning that the default value always gets used. `gin` lets you change that default value without editing the source code, and keeps track of the settings you used on `wandb`. 

The `examples/` show how almost every application of AMAGO looks the same aside from some minor `gin` configuration.

#### CNN Architecture Example
<details>

For example, let's say we want to switch the `CNNTstepEncoder` to use a larger IMPALA architecture with twice as many channels as usual. The constructor for `CNNTstepEncoder` looks like this:

```python
# amago/nets/tstep_encoders.py
@gin.configurable
class CNNTstepEncoder(TstepEncoder):
    def __init__(
        self,
        obs_space,
        rl2_space,
        cnn_type=cnn.NatureishCNN,
        channels_first: bool = False,
        img_features: int = 384,
        rl2_features: int = 12,
        d_output: int = 384,
        out_norm: str = "layer",
        activation: str = "leaky_relu",
        skip_rl2_norm: bool = False,
        hide_rl2s: bool = False,
        drqv2_aug: bool = False,
    ):
```

Following our rule, `obs_space` and `rl2_space` are going be determined for us, but nothing will try to set `cnn_type`, so it will default to `NatureishCNN`. The `IMPALAishCNN` looks like this:

```python
# amago/nets/cnn.poy
@gin.configurable
class IMPALAishCNN(CNN):
    def __init__(
        self,
        img_shape: tuple[int],
        channels_first: bool,
        activation: str,
        cnn_block_depths: list[int] = [16, 32, 32],
        post_group_norm: bool = True,
    ):
```
So we can change the `cnn_block_depths` and `post_group_norm` by editing these values, but this would *not* be the place to change the `activation`.
We could make our edits with `.gin` configuration files, but we could also just do this:

```python

from amago.nets.cnn import IMPALAishCNN
from amago.cli_utils import use_config

config = {
  "amago.nets.tstep_encoders.CNNTstepEncoder.cnn_type" : IMPALAishCNN,
  "amago.nets.cnn.IMPALAishCNN.cnn_block_depths" : [32, 64, 64],
}
# changes the default values
use_config(config)

experiment = Experiment(
  tstep_encoder_type=CNNTstepEncoder,
  ...
)
```

</details>

#### Transformer Architecture Example
<details>

As another example, let's say we want to use a `TformerTrajEncoder` with 6 layers of dimension 512, 16 heads, and sliding window attention with a window size of 256.

```python
# amago/nets/traj_encoders.py
@gin.configurable
class TformerTrajEncoder(TrajEncoder):
    def __init__(
        self,
        tstep_dim: int,
        max_seq_len: int,
        d_model: int = 256,
        n_heads: int = 8,
        d_ff: int = 1024,
        n_layers: int = 3,
        dropout_ff: float = 0.05,
        dropout_emb: float = 0.05,
        dropout_attn: float = 0.00,
        dropout_qkv: float = 0.00,
        activation: str = "leaky_relu",
        norm: str = "layer",
        causal: bool = True,
        sigma_reparam: bool = True,
        normformer_norms: bool = True,
        head_scaling: bool = True,
        attention_type: type[transformer.SelfAttention] = transformer.FlashAttention,
    ):


# amago/nets/transformer.py
@gin.configurable
class SlidingWindowFlexAttention(FlexAttention):
    def __init__(
        self,
        causal: bool = True,
        dropout: float = 0.0,
        window_size: int = gin.REQUIRED,
    ):
```

`gin.REQUIRED` is reserved for settings that are not commonly used but would be so important and task-specific that there is no good default. You'll get an error if you use one but forget to configure it.

```python
from amago.nets.traj_encoders import TformerTrajEncoder
from amago.nets.transformer import SlidingWindowFlexAttention
from amago.cli_utils import use_config

config = {
 "TformerTrajEncoder.n_heads" : 16,
 "TformerTrajEncoder.d_model" : 512,
 "TformerTrajEncoder.d_ff" : 2048,
 "TformerTrajEncoder.attention_type": SlidingWindowFlexAttention,
 "SlidingWindowFlexAttention.window_size" : 128,
}

use_config(config)
experiment = Experiment(
  traj_encoder_type=TformerTrajEncoder,
  ...
)
```
</details>

#### Exploration

<details>

Explorative action noise is implemented by `gymasium.Wrapper`s (`amago.envs.exploration`). Env creation automatically wraps the training envs in `Experiment.exploration_wrapper_type`, and these wrappers are `gin.configurable`. One thing to note that is that if the current exploration noise parameter is `epsilon_t`, the default behavior is for each actor to sample a `multiplier` in [0, 1) on each `reset` and set the exploration noise to `multiplier * epsilon_t`. In other words the exploration schedule defines the maximum possible value and we're randomizing over all the settings beneath it to reduce tuning. This can be disabled by `randomize_eps=False`.

```python
from amago.envs.exploration import EpsilonGreedy
from amago.cli_utils import use_config

config = {
  # exploration steps are measured in terms of timesteps *per actor*
  "EpsilonGreedy.steps_anneal" : 200_000,
  "EpsilonGreedy.eps_start" : 1.0,
  "EpsilonGreedy.eps_end" : .01,
  "EpsilonGreedy.randomize_eps" : False,
}
use_config(config)
experiment = Experiment(
  exploration_wrapper_type=EpsilonGreedy,
  ...
)
```
`EpsilonGreedy` is actually the default. The other built-in option is `BilevelEpsilonGreedy`, which is discussed in Appendix A of the paper and is designed for finite-horizon meta-RL problems.

</details>


#### An Easier Way
<details>

Customizing the built-in `TstepEncoder`s, `TrajEncoders`, `Agent`s, and `ExplorationWrapper`s is so common that there's easier ways to do it in `amago.cli_utils`. For example, we could've made the changes for all the previous examples at the same time with:

```python
from amago.cli_utils import switch_traj_encoder, switch_tstep_encoder, switch_agent, switch_exploration, use_config
from amago.nets.transformer import SlidingWindowFlexAttention
from amago.nets.cnn import IMPALAishCNN


config = {
  # these are niche changes customized a level below the `TstepEncoder` / `TrajEncoder`, so we still have to specify them
  "amago.nets.transformer.SlidingWindowFlexAttention.window_size" : 128,
  "amago.nets.cnn.IMPALAishCNN.cnn_block_depths" : [32, 64, 64],
}
tstep_encoder_type = switch_step_encoder(config, arch="cnn", cnn_type=IMPALAishCNN)
traj_encoder_type = switch_traj_encoder(config, arch="transformer", d_model=512, d_ff=2048, n_heads=16, attention_type=SlidingWindowFlexAttention)
exploration_wrapper_type = switch_exploration(config, strategy="egreedy", eps_start=1.0, eps_end=.01, steps_anneal=200_000)
# also customize random RL details as an example
agent_type = switch_agent(config, agent="multitask", num_critics=6, gamma=.998)
use_config(config)

experiment = Experiment(
  tstep_encoder_type=tstep_encoder_type,
  traj_encoder_type=traj_encoder_type,
  agent_type=agent_type,
  exploration_wrapper_type=exploration_wrapper_type,
  ...
)
```


If we want to combine hardcoded changes like these with genuine `.gin` files, `use_config` will take the paths.

```python
# these changes are applied in order from left to right. if we override the same param
# in multiple configs the final one will count. making gin this complicated is usually a bad idea.
use_config(config, gin_configs=["environment_config.gin", "rl_config.gin"])
```

</details>

<br>

### **7. Start the Experiment and Run Training**


Launch training with:

```python
experiment = amago.Experiment(...)
experiment.start()
experiment.learn()
```

Aside from the `wandb` logging metrics, AMAGO generates output files in the following format:

```bash
{Experiment.dset_root}/
    |-- {Experiment.dset_name}/
        |-- buffer/
        |    |-- protected/ # any data placed here will be sampled but never deleted
        |    |      |-- {env_name}_{random_id}_{unix_time}.traj # or .npz
        |    |      |-- ...
        |    |-- fifo/ # new data written here. oldest files deleted when > {Experiment.dset_max_size}
        |           |-- {environment_name}_{random_id}_{unix_time}.traj
        |           |-- {environment_name}_{another_random_id}_{later_unix_time}.traj
        |           |-- ...
        |
        |
        |-- {Experiment.run_name}/
            |-- config.txt # stores gin configuration details for reproducibility
            |-- policy.pt # the latest model weights
            |-- ckpts/
                    |-- training_states/
                    |    | # full checkpoint dirs used to restore `accelerate` training runs
                    |    |-- {Experiment.run_name}_epoch_0/
                    |    |-- {Experiment.run_name}_epoch_{Experiment.ckpt_interval}/
                    |    |-- ...
                    |
                    |-- policy_weights/
                        | # standard pytorch weight files
                        |-- policy_epoch_0.pt
                        |-- policy_epoch_{Experiment.ckpt_interval}.pt
                        |-- ...
        -- # other runs that share this replay buffer would be listed here
```

Each `epoch`, we:
1. Interact with the training envs for `train_timesteps_per_epoch`, creating a total of `parallel_actors * train_timesteps_per_epoch` new timesteps.
2. Save any training sequences that have finished to `dset_root/dset_name/buffer/`.
4. Compute the RL training objectives on `train_batches_per_epoch` batches sampled uniformly from all the files saved in `dset_root/dset_name/buffer`.  Gradient steps are taken every `batches_per_update` batches.


#### Offline RL and Replay Across Experiments
<details>

The path to the replay buffer is determined by `dset_root/dset_name`, not by the `run_name`: we can share the same replay buffer across multiple experiments or initialize the buffer to the result of a previous experiment. The buffer is divided into two partitions `fifo`  and `protected`. `fifo` imitates a standard replay buffer by deleting the oldest data when full. `protected` data is sampled but never deleted. The best way to do offline RL is to move the offline dataset into `dset_root/dset_name/buffer/protected` and set `start_collecting_at_epoch = float("inf")`. This will likely involve converting our offline RL dataset to `hindsight.Trajectory`s and saving them to disk (examples coming soon). Any online fine-tuning after `start_collecting_at_epoch` would follow the [DQfD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03732) style of preserving the initial dataset while collecting our own online dataset in `fifo` and sampling uniformly from both.

</details>

<br>

### Track the Results

AMAGO uses [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) to track experiments. Each run is tracked on a webpage we can view from any browser. Configure `wandb` experiment with:

```python

experiment = Experiment(
  log_to_wandb=True,
  wandb_project="my_project_name",
  wandb_entity="my_wandb_username",
  run_name="my_run_name",
  ...,
)
```

Or set the environment variables `AMAGO_WANDB_PROJECT` and `AMAGO_WANDB_ENTITY`. Once training or evaluation begins, this run would appear at `https://wandb.ai/my_wandb_username/my_project_name/` under the name `my_run_name`.


#### Interpreting the `wandb` Metrics 

<details>

Data is organized into sections. From top to bottom:
1. `test/`: If the run has finished and called `Experiment.evaluate_test`, the test metrics would be here. Test metrics are usually the same as `val/` (see below).
2. `buffer/`: A short section tracking the size of the replay buffer on disk.
3. `Charts/`: These are your x-axis options. More on this in a moment.
4. `train/`: RL training metrics for debugging. Many of the metrics will be familiar but others are unique to AMAGO implementation details. You can probably ignore this section unless training is not going well and you want to dig into why that is. Most of this data is generated during [`Agent.forward`](https://github.com/UT-Austin-RPL/amago/blob/c06844bd38d02a47f13989b03ebe41c3ad2e54e9/amago/agent.py#L203).
5. **`val/`: Contains the policy evaluation metrics**. `"Average Total Return (Across All Env Names)"` is the typical average return during eval rollouts. The return is also broken down by "environment name". The environment name is set by the `AMAGOEnv` (see the top section of this tutorial) and is used to track results for each task in multi-task experiments. We also log the "Bottom Quintile" return by environment name. There might be many more metrics here depending on the environment/experiment. For example, some envs track a "success rate" and some meta-RL envs record stats by episode/attempt.

6. `System/`: These are hardware-related metrics that are logged automatically by `wandb`.

**The default `wandb` x-axis ("Step") isn't very useful --- it's the number of times `wandb.log` has been called.** We can change the x-axis in the top right corner. `"Wall Time"` is available by default and we can plot any train/val metric by the names in the `Charts/` section. **`total_frames` is the typical RL learning curve x-axis showing the total number of times we've called `env.step` to collect data**. Yes, it should've been named total_timesteps 😄... there used to be a reason for this. In multi-task settings we will also find the total frames collected in each individual "environment name". You can also plot metrics by the training `Epoch` or `gradient_steps`.

#### Command and Configuration
If we click on "Overview" (in the top left corner), we'll find a record of the command that was used to launch the experiment. We'll also find a "Config" section that lists all of the `gin` settings for this run.

### **Train and Learn Asychronously on Multiple GPUs**

#### Multi-GPU DistributedDataParallel

AMAGO can replicate the same (rollout --> learn) loop on multiple GPUs in `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) mode. We simplify DDP setup with [`huggingface/accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/index). 

<details>

To use accelerate, run `accelerate config` and answer the questions. `accelerate` is mainly used for distributed LLM training and many of its features don't apply here. For our purposes, the answer to most questions is "NO", unless we're being asked about the GPU count, IDs, or float precision.

Then, to use the GPUs you requested during `accelerate config`, we'd replace a command that noramlly looks like this:

```bash
python my_training_script.py --run_name agi --env CartPole-v1 ...
```

with:

```bash
accelerate launch my_training_script.py --run_name agi --env CartPole-v1 ...
```

And that's it! Let's say our `Experiment.parallel_actors=32`, `Experiment.train_timesteps_per_epoch=1000`, `Experiment.batch_size=32`, and `Experiment.batches_per_epoch=500`. On a single GPU this means we're collecting 32 x 1000 = 32k timesteps per epoch, and training on 500 batches each with 32 sequences. If we decided to use 4 GPUs during `accelerate config`, these same arguments would lead to 4 x 32 x 1000 = 128k timesteps collected per epoch, and we'd still be doing 500 grad updates per epoch with 32 sequences per GPU, but the effective batch size would now be 4 x 32 = 128. Realistically, we're using multiple GPUs to save memory on long sequences and we'd  want to change the batch size to 8 to recover the original batch size of 4 x 8 = 32 while avoiding OOM errors.

> *NOTE*: Validation metrics (`val/` on `wandb`) average over `accelerate` processes, but the `train/` metrics are only logged from the main process (the lowest GPU index) and would have a sample size of a single GPU's batch dim.

</details>

#### Asynchronous Training/Rollouts

Each `epoch` alternates between rollouts --> gradient updates. AMAGO saves environment data and checkpoints to disk, so changing some `amago.learning.Experiment` kwargs would let these two steps be completely separate. 


<details>

After we create an `experiment = Experiment()`, but before `experiment.start()`, `cli_utils.switch_async_mode` can override settings to `"learn"`, `"collect"` or do `"both"` (the default). This leads to a very hacky but fun way to add extra data collection or do training/learning asychronously. For example, we can `accelerate launch` a multi-gpu script that only does gradient updates, and collect data for that model to train on with as many collect-only processes as we want. All we need to do is make sure the `dset_root`, `dset_name`, `run_name` are the same (so that all the experiments are working from the same directory), and the network architecture settings are the same (so that checkpoints load correctly). For example:

```python
#  my_training_script.py
from argparse import ArgumentParser()
from amago.cli_utils import switch_async_mode, use_config

parser = ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--mode", options=["learn", "collect", "both"])
args = parser.parse_args()

config = {
  ...
}
use_config(config)


experiment = Experiment(
  dset_root="~/amago_dsets",
  dset_name="agi_training_data",
  run_name="v1",
  tstep_encoder_type=FFTstepEncoder,
  traj_encoder_type=TformerTrajEncoder,
  agent_type=MultiTaskAgent,
  ...
)
switch_async_mode(experiment, args.mode)
experiment.start()
experiment.learn()
```

`accelerate config` a 4-gpu training process on GPU ids 1, 2, 3, 4
Then:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5 python my_training_script.py --mode collect # on a free GPU
```

```python
accelerate launch my_training_script.py --mode train
```

And now we're collecting data on 1 gpu and doing DDP gradient updates on 4 others. At any time during training we could decide to add another `--mode collect` process to boost our framerate. This all just kinda works because the AMAGO learning update is way-off-policy (`Agent`) or fully offline (`MultiTaskAgent`). Of course this could be made less hacky by writing one script that starts the collection process, waits until the replay buffer isn't empty, then starts the training process. We are working on some very large training runs and you can expect these features to be much easier to use in the future.
